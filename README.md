# Omni ePartners Front End Interview Project

## Instructions

We would like you to build a single HTML page using this project and save the results in your own personal fork for submission. There is a sample dataset located inside the `src/app/app.component.ts` for customer review data from an e-commerce platform.  The task is to present this data in an interesting way--you can use any library or CSS framework you'd like to accomplish this.
Your HTML code will be edited entirely inside of the `src/app/app.component.html` file and your SCSS code will be located inside of `src/app/app.component.scss` if you'd like to take it a step further and create components that is encouraged but not necessary for this project.

Use graphs, tables, and other visual design techniques you know to present the data. Submissions will be judged by our team and we will discuss the results in your in-person interview. There is no time limit and feel free to impress us with your work! :)

## Libraries we like to use (you may like them too)

Angular Material Design: https://material.angular.io/
D3: https://d3js.org/
ngx-charts: https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-charts
Prime-NG: https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/

## How to Use this Angular Boilerplate

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
